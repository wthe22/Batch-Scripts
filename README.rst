Batch Scripts
#############
Collection of batch scripts created over the years, as a hobby, mostly to
practice programming and some for personal use too.

Compatibility
-------------
Nowadays most scripts developed on Windows 10. However, most likely scripts are
compatible with Windows 7 too. Scripts released on 2016 or earlier were
developed on Windows 7. Only a few scripts are developed with or compatible with
Windows XP or earlier.

XP compatibility can be known by checking whether the script uses the
``timeout``, ``choice``, and ``certutil`` command. If none of these commands
are used, there is a good chance that the script is compatible with XP.
